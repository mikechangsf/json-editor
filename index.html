<h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Salon JSON-ator</h1>
<h2>What the heck is this?</h2>
<p>
    This is a web form that allows anyone to create a JSON that matches (mostly) with our Firebase database. It still
    requires a little bit of validation/post-processing by an engineer. However, this allows generation of a JSON for a
    new salon, new service for easy entry into our database.
    <br/>This does not replace the development of the admin project. Only the database schema should serve as a
    reference, not the UI itself.
</p>


<h2>To Manually Add a Salon</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add a salon via <a href="salon_entry.html">Salon Entry</a> page by filling out the fields</li>
    <li>Once done, get the raw JSON from the<a
            href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/zw1z2pfbb7mx1d3/Screenshot%202017-04-07%2016.29.08.png?dl=0'> right side</a>.
        Save this as new_salon_SALON_NAME.json
    </li>
    <li>Add the list of <a href="services_entry.html">Services Entry</a>. Note that in this form,</li>
    <li>Like salon entry, get the raw JSON and save it as new_services_SALON_NAME.json</li>
    <li>Send both files to an engineer for validation and entry</li>

</ol>

<h2>Differences between genereated JSON and Firebase</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The list of services is not supposed to be an array. It should be a 'Firebase Array', which is a list of objects
        with unique keys
    </li>
    <li>
        There's a bug with JSON-editor enumSource and integer. Salon-hours needs to be long (remove quote) and month of holiday needs to be long.
    </li>
</ul>
